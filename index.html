        Is it possible to capture clear photographs of bullets as they
        travel through the air, even if they're moving faster than the
        speed of sound? What about photographs of objects being penetrated
        by bullets at the time of the impact? Here we discuss the concepts
        behind photographing this subject as well as the necessary materials
        for doing so.
        <br>
        <br>
        The single most important idea behind taking these crisp photos is 
        that the exposure time must be very short. This is because the bullet
        will be moving at a very high speed, so we require that the flash be 
        short enough to minimize motion blur. In this example, we use a .22 
        caliber rifle with 25.4mm long bullets, which travel at approximately 340m/s.
        This means that to get an unnoticeable motion blur, we want the subject to move
        just around .1% of the subject's length. Therefore,
        we need to capture it before it can travel a distance of .0254mm. The time
        it takes for this to happen is just (.0254mm)/(340m/s) = .0747ms. Finding a 
        strobe that will fire for just this short amount of time will allow us
        to photograph a moving bullet.
        <br>
        <br>
        With this information in mind, we know that we can get a good photograph 
        if we use some short enough exposure time. There are two ways to 
        get this - either by having the shutter open for just .0747ms, or by using a 
        light source that lasts just .0747ms. In this experiment, we will work 
        with a strobe with a flash just under .0747ms.

        * Other subjects may be used. Caveat: it is best to use small and
        relatively soft subjects so as to not deflect the bullet.

        The procedure for taking these photos is outlined below:
        <ol>
          <li><span>1.</span><p><b>Setup the Subject.</b> Begin by ensuring
            that the subject is in the correct position. In order to take the 
            photo of the crayon, we propped the crayon up with some clay
            along the line of fire of the rifle. To take the photo of the playing
            card, we inserted it into one of the ridges of the chalkboard eraser
            so it would stand up straight.</p></li>
          <li><span>2.</span><p><b>Setup the Rifle.</b> Secure the rifle 
            in the appropriate position by looking through the sights. If 
            applicable, use the halogen lamp to light the edge of the card
            for better accuracy. Make sure that the appropriate edge of the
            subject is bisected by the sights and is not twisted in any direction.</p></li>
          <li><span>3.</span><p><b>Setup the Camera.</b> Adjust the camera
            such that it is perpendicular to the line of fire from the rifle.
            Make sure to frame the subject such that there is ample space for 
            the subject, any interesting debris, and the bullet.</p></li>
          <li><span>4.</span><p><b>Setup the Strobe.</b> Position the strobe such
            that the hotspot from the strobe hits the subject as desired. Take 
            a couple shots of the subject with the strobe to get the best
            exposure. Make sure to place the sensor and set the delay with
            appropriate numbers to catch the bullet in the desired position.</p></li>
          <li><span>5.</span><p><b>Take Photos.</b>
          <ol id="sublist">
              <li>Once everything is set up properly, ensure everyone is in a safe location.</li>
              <li>Then, load the bullet into the gun.</li>
              <li>Check that eye and ear protection are properly worn.</li>
              <li>Next, turn off the lights.</li>
              <li>Open the shutter to the camera.</li>
